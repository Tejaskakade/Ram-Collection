- **Servlets**: Java Servlets are used for request handling, such as managing the shopping cart, processing checkout, and user login.
- **Bootstrap**: The front-end is styled using **Bootstrap** to create a responsive and modern design with minimal custom CSS.
- **HTML**: HTML is used to structure the pages, including product pages, cart pages, and the home page.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS is used in conjunction with Bootstrap to style specific components like buttons, headers, and product lists.

- **Checkout Process**: Users can view their cart, enter shipping details, and submit orders (this may be extended with real payment integration in future versions).

## Detailed Breakdown of Technologies

### 1. **Java and Servlets**:
   - **Java** is used for the core business logic of the application, handling all the interactions between the database (if applicable) and the user interface.
   - **Servlets** are used to manage user requests and send responses. For example:
     - **ProductServlet** handles displaying product details.
     - **LoginServlet** handles user authentication (login and registration).
     - **CartServlet** manages adding, updating, and removing items from the shopping cart.
     - **CheckoutServlet** processes the order once the user is ready to purchase.

### 2. **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**:
   - **JSP** is used to dynamically render content on the webpage by combining HTML with Java code. Some specific uses:
     - **Product Page**: Dynamically displaying product information (name, image, price, etc.) from the backend.
     - **Cart Page**: Dynamically displaying the contents of the shopping cart (items added, quantities, prices).
     - **Home Page**: Displaying featured products or categories using data passed from Java Servlets.

### 3. **Bootstrap**:
   - **Bootstrap** is used to create a responsive and modern layout with minimal effort. Key usage:
     - **Grid System**: The website layout is built using the Bootstrap grid system to ensure responsiveness across devices.
     - **Navigation Bar**: A responsive navigation bar is created with Bootstrap components for easy browsing.
     - **Buttons & Forms**: Styled buttons and form elements (like add-to-cart buttons, login forms, etc.) are styled using Bootstrapâ€™s predefined classes.

### 4. **HTML**:
   - **HTML** is used to structure the website's content:
     - Pages like the **Home page**, **Product details page**, **Cart page**, and **Checkout page** are structured with HTML to define headings, links, tables, forms, and more.
     - Static content such as headings, descriptions, and product images are embedded using HTML.

### 5. **CSS**:
   - **CSS** is used to add custom styles to the website beyond what Bootstrap provides:
     - Custom fonts, colors, and styles for the **footer**, **buttons**, and **product grid**.
     - Hover effects and animations are added using CSS for a better user experience.
